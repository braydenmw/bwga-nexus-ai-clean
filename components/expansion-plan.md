# BWGA Nexus AI Report System Expansion Plan

## Overview
Expand the current 5-step wizard to a comprehensive 9-step system organized in 3 phases, with enhanced report generation options and improved UI organization.

## Current State Analysis
- **Existing Steps**: 5 steps (Context Entry, RROI, TPT, SEAM, NSIL)
- **Structure**: Linear progression with basic stepper
- **UI**: Simple step-by-step wizard with sidebar
- **Features**: Basic report generation, limited customization

## Target Architecture

### Phase 1: Context & Planning (Steps 1-3)
1. **Strategic Context Definition** - Enhanced context entry with stakeholder analysis
2. **Opportunity Assessment** - Market research and opportunity identification
3. **Partnership Intent Clarification** - Define partnership goals and criteria

### Phase 2: Analysis & Assessment (Steps 4-6)
4. **Regional Diagnostic (RROI)** - Economic readiness analysis
5. **Predictive Positioning (TPT)** - Transformation pathway simulation
6. **Ecosystem Mapping (SEAM)** - Partnership network architecture

### Phase 3: Strategy & Execution (Steps 7-9)
7. **Risk Assessment & Mitigation** - Comprehensive risk analysis
8. **Implementation Planning** - Actionable execution roadmap
9. **Intelligence Blueprint & Presentation (NSIL)** - Final report generation

## Enhanced Features

### Report Generation Options
- **Length Options**: Summary (2-3 pages), Standard (5-7 pages), Comprehensive (10-15 pages)
- **Format Options**: Report Only, Letter Only, Report + Letter
- **Customization**: Dynamic content based on selections

### UI Improvements
- **Phase-based Grouping**: Visual separation of the 3 phases
- **Collapsible Sections**: Completed phases can be collapsed
- **Progress Tracking**: Phase-level and step-level progress indicators
- **Enhanced Stepper**: Phase indicators with visual progress bars

### Integration Features
- **Letter Generation**: Integrated workflow for partnership outreach
- **AI Guidance**: Enhanced Nexus Enquire AI for all 9 steps
- **Progress Persistence**: Save and resume across sessions

## Implementation Status - COMPLETED ✅

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Structure Updates
1. **Updated WIZARD_STEPS array** with 9 steps organized in 3 phases:
   - Phase 1: Context & Planning (Steps 1-3)
   - Phase 2: Analysis & Assessment (Steps 4-6)
   - Phase 3: Strategy & Execution (Steps 7-9)
2. **Created 4 new step components**:
   - `OpportunityAssessmentStep.tsx` - Market research and opportunity identification
   - `PartnershipIntentStep.tsx` - Partnership goals and criteria definition
   - `RiskAssessmentStep.tsx` - Comprehensive risk analysis and mitigation
   - `ImplementationPlanningStep.tsx` - Roadmap, timeline, and resource planning
3. **Enhanced EnhancedStepper** with phase-based grouping and visual indicators

### ✅ Phase 2: UI Enhancements
1. **Implemented collapsible phase sections** with show/hide overview functionality
2. **Added visual progress tracking** across phases with phase-level progress bars
3. **Updated step summary logic** for all 9 steps with phase metadata

### ✅ Phase 3: Feature Integration
1. **Integrated letter generation workflow** with modal and customizable options
2. **Added report customization options** (length, format, letter configuration)
3. **Enhanced navigation logic** to allow phase-based step access

### ✅ Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. **Build verification** - Project compiles successfully without errors
2. **Component integration** - All new step components properly imported and rendered
3. **UI consistency** - Phase-based design maintains visual coherence
